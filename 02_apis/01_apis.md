# Open Gateway APIs

Open Gateway APIs represent an innovative initiative led by the GSMA and  telecommunications operators to create a standardized framework of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). These APIs enable simplified and universal access to advanced mobile network capabilities and associated services. Designed to promote interoperability, innovation, and operational efficiency within the digital ecosystem, Open Gateway APIs are essential for modern application development.

Open Gateway enables software developers to leverage Network Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for building applications that seamlessly communicate with underlying networks. These APIs provide a consistent method for accessing analytical and statistical data from networks, facilitating the implementation of customer experience-focused use cases. Open Gateway empowers developers to retrieve network information and request configuration changes efficiently.

Open Gateway utilizes these network APIs to offer a unified standard interface across multiple operator networks worldwide, abstracting the inherent complexities associated with network APIs. This approach simplifies integration and enhances interoperability for developers and applications alike.

## Technical Description of Open Gateway APIs

### Interoperability and Open Standards

Open Gateway APIs are built on open standards that ensure interoperability between different telecommunications operators and development platforms. By adopting common technical specifications and universal protocols, these APIs facilitate the integration of services and applications across various mobile networks, including 4G, 5G, and future technologies.

### API Architecture

Open Gateway APIs are designed using a _RESTful_ (Representational State Transfer) architecture, enabling simple and efficient communication between clients and servers through standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This architecture is highly scalable and easy to implement, making it ideal for distributed and high-performance environments.

### Security and Authentication

Open Gateway APIs implement robust security and authentication mechanisms to protect data integrity and confidentiality. This includes the use of _OAuth 2.0_ for authorization and _JWT_ (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user and application authentication.

## Available APIs

### SIM Swap

The **standardized SIM Swap API** enables seamless integration of **SIM swap detection** and **management functionality** into your applications. This API enhances security by **identifying potentially fraudulent activity** and providing an **additional layer of protection** against unauthorized access.

Additionally, the **SIM Swap's Unified API Access** feature ensures **access to network capabilities** of various carriers through a **single, standardized interface**. This simplifies integration and improves efficiency for developers by consolidating access to multiple carrier networks.

### Device location

The standardised Device Location Verification API provides the option of verifying the geographical location of a given SIM-based device and validating whether it is within a requested geographical area without spoofing or GPS.

This solution validates the location of a device to enable services or allow transactions by verifying the location.


### Number Verification API

The **standardized Number Verification API** enhances the security of your users' identities and credentials. This API provides a quick, convenient, reliable, and secure method for verifying user information, ensuring robust protection against unauthorized access.

### Quality on Demand Mobile (QoD Mobile) API

The **standardized QoD Mobile API** allows you to manage and control your customers' mobile connectivity. This capability enables you to focus on creating the best possible user experiences, ensuring optimal performance and reliability for mobile applications.

### Quality on Demand WiFi (QoD WiFi) API

The **QoD WiFi API** lets you configure and manage the quality of service for devices connected to a single Wi-Fi network. This API enhances the user experience for digital services within the home by providing greater control over the quality of service on demand. It is especially useful for technologies such as virtual reality, augmented reality, cloud gaming, and voice over IP.
