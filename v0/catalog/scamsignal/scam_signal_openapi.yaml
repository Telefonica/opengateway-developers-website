        The Scam Signal API is designed to help prevent scams in real-time by offering a telecom-powered risk signal. This allows businesses to:

        - Pause suspicious payment attempts
        - Trigger customer verification flows
        - Reduce false positives in fraud scoring systems

        It has proven to reduce fraud losses and improve user safety in sensitive flows such as online banking and high-value transactions.

        **Note:** Due to the sensitive nature of this API, parameters and schema are not publicly disclosed.

        Key business use cases include:
        - Preventing real-time payment scams (e.g. APP fraud)
        - Adding telecom signals to existing fraud detection models
