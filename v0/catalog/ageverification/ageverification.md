The standardized Age Verification API allows businesses to determine if users meet required age thresholds for accessing age-restricted subscriptions and services using verified data from mobile network operators.

This API is essential in regulated sectors such as online gambling, alcohol sales, or digital media with age restrictions, helping to block unauthorized access and eliminate fake accounts. The Age Verification API enables this verification privately and in real-time.

## Overview of the Age Verification API

### High level definition

The Age Verification CAMARA API is a software interface that enables businesses to verify if a user meets a specified age threshold by leveraging verified data collected and maintained by mobile network operators during SIM card registration or customer account setup.

### API Operations

The Age Verification CAMARA API specifies one operation:

- **POST /verify**: Verifies that the age of the subscriber associated with a phone number is equal to or greater than the specified age threshold value. The response may optionally include additional information such as identity match score, verified status, content lock, and parental control information.

## Why Age Verification?

The Age Verification API helps businesses identify age thresholds of mobile line users in real-time, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements while maintaining user privacy and streamlining verification processes.

### Process Simplification

Eliminates the need for users to submit identification photos or undergo biometric controls during initial interactions by leveraging verified data from mobile operators to confirm age instantly. This reduces friction in user onboarding while maintaining security and compliance.

### Trust and Traceability

Leverages data collected and verified by mobile operators during SIM card registration or customer account setup. This ensures age confirmation is based on a reliable, law-compliant source rather than user-provided data, reducing the risk of fraud and false information.

### Real-time Verification

Ideal for user verification, access control, and handling large transaction volumes without the common problems associated with document or image verification. Provides instant results that can be integrated into existing workflows seamlessly.

### Configurable Thresholds

The API allows adjustment of minimum age requirements (such as 18 or 21 years) according to business needs, industry requirements, or local laws. Verifications adapt to each market and include user-defined filters to improve accuracy and avoid incorrect results.

### Standardized Access

The CAMARA-standardized Age Verification API enables single integration to work with operators worldwide, without the need for custom agreements. This standardization simplifies development and reduces integration complexity across multiple markets.

### Privacy by Design

Uses only necessary data: indicates whether a person meets the minimum age requirement (e.g., 18 years) without sharing their birth date, documents, or other personal data. This better protects confidential information while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.

### Enhanced Security Features

The API can optionally provide additional security information including:

- **Identity Match Score**: Indicates confidence level in the verification result
- **Verified Status**: Shows if information has been verified against legally accepted identification documents  
- **Content Lock**: Indicates if the subscription has content filtering enabled
- **Parental Control**: Shows if parental control features are activated

### Fraud Prevention

By utilizing verified operator data rather than user-submitted information, the API significantly reduces the risk of identity fraud, synthetic identities, and account manipulation commonly associated with traditional age verification methods.
