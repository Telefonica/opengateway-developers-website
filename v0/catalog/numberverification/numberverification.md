The Number Verification API is part of the Open Gateway initiative, providing developers with access to network-based phone number validation. This API verifies user identity by confirming phone number ownership through network operator mechanisms, eliminating the need for manual verification processes.

## API Overview

### Technical Definition

The Number Verification CAMARA API validates user identity by confirming that the provided phone number matches the number associated with the user's device connection to the mobile network operator.

### Available Operations

- **POST verify:** Validates if the provided phone number matches the device's registered number. Returns a boolean result indicating verification status.

	[Check the API Reference](/reference/phonenumberverify-2)
  
- **GET device-phone-number:** Retrieves the phone number associated with the user's device without requiring input parameters.

	***This feature is pending availability***


### Technical Implementation

The API leverages network operator infrastructure to perform verification without requiring user interaction. This network-based approach provides:

- Real-time validation against operator records
- No dependency on SMS or voice calls
- Transparent verification process for end users
- Integration with existing network authentication mechanisms

The API can be combined with other Open Gateway APIs such as Device Location Verification or SIM SWAP detection to create comprehensive security solutions.

### Why Frontend-Initiated Authentication is Required

The Number Verification API uses **Authorization Code Flow** (frontend-initiated) instead of **CIBA (Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication)** for a critical technical reason:

**IP Address Verification**: The core verification mechanism compares the phone number being verified against the IP address that the mobile network operator has assigned to that specific SIM card. This comparison can only be performed when the request originates from the user's mobile device.

**Technical Implementation**:
- When a user's device connects to the mobile network, the operator assigns a specific IP address to that SIM card
- The verification request must come from this assigned IP address to establish the connection between the phone number and the device
- If the request originates from your backend server, the operator sees your datacenter's IP address instead of the user's mobile IP
- This breaks the verification chain, as there's no way to correlate your server's IP with the user's phone number

**Why CIBA Cannot Work for Number Verification**:
- CIBA flows are backend-initiated and use the server's IP address
- The mobile operator cannot establish a relationship between your server's IP and the user's phone number
- The fundamental verification mechanism (IP-to-phone-number matching) becomes impossible

This architectural requirement ensures that verification is truly tied to the physical device and SIM card being used, providing authentic network-level validation that cannot be spoofed or bypassed.

## Use Cases and Benefits

Traditional verification methods using SMS or voice calls are vulnerable to SIM swapping, interception, and social engineering attacks. The Number Verification API addresses these security challenges through network-level validation.

### Key Advantages

**Network-Based Verification:** Utilizes the mobile network operator's authentication mechanisms, providing verification without user interaction or exposure to interception.

**Real-Time Validation:** Immediate confirmation of phone number ownership through active network connection verification.

**Enhanced Security:** Eliminates vulnerabilities associated with SMS-based verification, including SIM swapping and message interception.

**Seamless Integration:** RESTful API design enables straightforward integration into existing authentication workflows.

The API verifies that the provided mobile phone number (MSISDN) corresponds to the device establishing the data connection, ensuring users access services from authenticated devices.


### Network-Level Authentication Mechanism

The Number Verification API performs authentication through **network infrastructure validation**:

**Core Verification Process**:
1. **IP Address Correlation**: The mobile operator identifies which SIM card is assigned to the IP address making the request
2. **Phone Number Matching**: The operator compares the provided phone number with the SIM card associated with that IP address
3. **Real-Time Validation**: This comparison happens instantly using live network data, not stored databases

**Technical Advantages**:
- **No User Interaction Required**: Verification is transparent to the end user
- **Immune to SIM Swapping**: Uses current network connection, not historical data
- **Cannot Be Intercepted**: No SMS or voice calls that can be redirected
- **Spoofing-Resistant**: Requires actual network connection from the specific SIM card

**Key Advantages Over Traditional Methods**:
- **Network-Based Verification**: Utilizes mobile operator authentication mechanisms without user interaction
- **Real-Time Validation**: Immediate confirmation through active network connection verification  
- **Enhanced Security**: Eliminates SMS/voice vulnerabilities including SIM swapping and interception
- **Seamless Integration**: RESTful API design for straightforward authentication workflow integration
- **Spoofing-Resistant**: Requires actual network connection from the specific SIM card

This verification confirms that the provided mobile phone number (MSISDN) corresponds to the SIM card currently establishing the data connection, ensuring authentic device-to-identity binding.
