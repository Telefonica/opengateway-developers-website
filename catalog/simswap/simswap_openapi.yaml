  title: SIM Swap
  description: |
    SIM Swap API provides the customer the ability to obtain information on any recent SIM pairing change related to the User's mobile account.
    
    This API derives from the GSMA Mobile Connect Account Takeover Protection specification [Mobile Connect Account Takeover Protection](https://www.gsma.com/identity/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IDY.24-Mobile-Connect-Account-Takeover-Protection-Definition-and-Technical-Requirements-v2.0.pdf).  For more about Mobile Connect, please see [about Mobile Connect](https://mobileconnect.io/).

    The API provides 2 operations:

    - POST retrieve-date : Provides timestamp of latest SIM swap

    - POST check: Checks if SIM swap has been performed during a past period (defined in the request with 'maxAge' attribute).
