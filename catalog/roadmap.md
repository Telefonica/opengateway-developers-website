## Technically available APIs

The following APIs are already available on most telcos' API exposure platforms, and are about to be made commercially available according to every region's legal and privacy requirements.

Get sure to get onboarded on the Open Gateway Developer Hub to get early access to these APIs and start testing them in our <a href="/docs/sandbox">Sandbox environment</a>.

### Device location

The standardised Device Location Verification API provides the option of verifying the geographical location of a given SIM-based device and validating whether it is within a requested geographical area without spoofing or GPS.

This solution validates the location of a device to enable services or allow transactions by verifying the location.

### Device status

The standardised Device Status API provides information regarding particular conditions of devices equipped with the end-user's SIM card, such as whether the device is in a roaming state and the country it is in.

Again, this API enables use cases around specific services related to the end-user's situation, or preventing frauds from foreign locations.

### Home Devices Quality on Demand (QoD WiFi) API

The standardized Home Devices QoD API lets you configure and manage the quality of service for devices connected to a single Wi-Fi network. This API enhances the user experience for digital services within the home by providing greater control over the quality of service on demand. It is especially useful for technologies such as virtual reality, augmented reality, cloud gaming, and voice over IP.
