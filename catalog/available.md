Open Gateway enables software developers to leverage Telco Application Programming Interfaces (Telco APIs) for building applications that seamlessly integrate our underlying networks' capabilities and operators' data. These APIs provide a consistent method for accessing analytical and statistical data from networks, facilitating the implementation of customer experience-focused use cases. Open Gateway empowers developers to retrieve network information and request configuration changes efficiently.

Open Gateway utilizes these Telco APIs to offer a unified standard interface across multiple operator networks worldwide, abstracting the inherent complexities associated with their systems and infrastructures. This approach simplifies integration and enhances interoperability for developers and applications alike.

## Technical Description of Open Gateway APIs

### Interoperability and Open Standards

Open Gateway APIs are built on open standards that ensure interoperability between different telecommunications operators and development platforms. By adopting common technical specifications and universal protocols, these APIs facilitate the integration of services and applications across various mobile networks, including 4G, 5G, and future technologies.

### API Architecture

Open Gateway APIs are designed using a _RESTful_ (Representational State Transfer) architecture, enabling simple and efficient communication between clients and servers through standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This architecture is highly scalable and easy to implement, making it ideal for distributed and high-performance environments.

### Security and Authentication

Open Gateway APIs implement robust security and authentication mechanisms to protect data integrity and confidentiality. This includes the use of _OAuth 2.0_ for authorization and _JWT_ (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user and application authentication.

## Commercially available APIs

As the Open Gateway Channel Partners start aggregating the APIs from the operators, the following APIs are already available in some regions for developers to use:

### SIM Swap

The standardized SIM Swap API enables seamless integration of SIM swap detection and management functionality into your applications. This API enhances security by identifying potentially fraudulent activity and providing an additional layer of protection against unauthorized access.

Additionally, the SIM Swap's Unified API Access feature ensures access to network capabilities of various carriers through a single, standardized interface. This simplifies integration and improves efficiency for developers by consolidating access to multiple carrier networks.

### Number Verification API

The standardized Number Verification API enhances the security of your users' identities and credentials. This API provides a quick, convenient, reliable, and secure method for verifying user information, ensuring robust protection against unauthorized access.
