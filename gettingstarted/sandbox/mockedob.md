# Mock Operator Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides a technical guide to the **Mock Operator** deployed in the Open Gayeway Sandbox, a controlled testing space designed for developers to validate API integrations and simulate various scenarios. The Mock Operator mirrors the behavior of production APIs, allowing developers to test their applications without relying on live systems or data.

By using this environment, developers can simulate different API responses, including errors and edge cases, ensuring that their integrations handle all expected conditions before deployment.
