## On privacy

Having actual operator's mobile lines in you whitelist is mandatory for testing the APIs in the production mode. This way, you as a tester can make real calls to the operators' APIs and get real responses without compromising anyone else's privacy by accessing just your own line's data.

Check the [Privacy](/docs/privacy.md) section for more information on why Open Gateway is Privacy by Design.

## Adding your mobile lines to the whitelist

In order to add your lines to the whitelist, just fill-in the text fields at the bottom of the [production environments access application form](https://opengateway.telefonica.com/en/sandbox/registration). Our Developer Hub support team will review your request and will get back to you with the confirmation of the addition of your lines to the whitelist.

In coming releases, you will be able to manage your whitelist from the Sandbox console.
