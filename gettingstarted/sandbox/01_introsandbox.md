title: Sandbox
excerpt: In this section you will know what is the Telefónica Open Gateway Sandbox environment to test the Open Gateway APIs without the need to subscribe to a Channel Partner. Your tests won't be charged and won't be suitable for going into a production stage, so it is a great chance to learn and prototype, as a previous step to go commercial.

The Sandbox in Open Gateway is a secure and free testing environment that allows developers to experiment with Open Gateway APIs without any risk to live systems. This isolated space is designed to help developers validate their applications, ensuring they work as intended before deployment. By providing access to all the necessary tools and resources, the Sandbox allows developers to simulate real-world scenarios and thoroughly test API integrations.

One of the key advantages of the Open Gateway Sandbox is its ability to offer a risk-free environment where developers can troubleshoot issues, refine their code, and optimize performance without impacting actual data or services. This ensures that any potential bugs or errors are identified and resolved early in the development process, leading to more reliable and secure applications when they go live.

Additionally, the free access to the Sandbox makes it an invaluable resource for developers, especially those working on tight budgets or within smaller teams. It provides all the benefits of a robust testing environment without the associated costs, allowing developers to focus on creating high-quality applications. By using the Sandbox, developers can ensure that their solutions are fully functional, secure, and optimized, paving the way for a smoother and more successful deployment.
Please note that the usage of credentials granted from our Sandbox might be subject to some limitations in order to let you test without the obligations of a commercial contract. The terms and conditions of our developer or partner programs will apply.

## Getting onboarded

The only requirement to start using the Open Gateway Sandbox is to join one of our programs. Please check which one best fit your needs. You can also request to join both:

- [Open Gateway Developer Hub](https://opengateway.telefonica.com/en/developer-hub)
- [Open Gateway Partner Program](https://opengateway.telefonica.com/en/partner-program)

Once you are approved in at least one of our programs and you log in to the private area of the Telefónica Open Gateway website, you already have access to the Sandbox web console as a program member from the Technical Toolbox section.

## How to use the Sandbox

Discover how to utilize the Open Gateway Sandbox, a no-cost, secure space for testing and perfecting your applications with realistic API scenarios prior to going live.  [Our detailed guide](02_usethesandbox.md) will help you optimize your development workflow and ensure a seamless deployment.

## SDK reference

You can check the reference of the current Sandbox SDK reference in the [Python Sandbox SDK](03_sdkreference.md) guide. The scope of the APIs covered and the programming languages supported will be extended progressively according to the Sandbox roadmap.
