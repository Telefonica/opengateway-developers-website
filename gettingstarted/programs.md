# Open Gateway Programs 

Once you are familiar with the Open Gateway initiative and the APIs we offer, you will want to have to access additional resources and start testing the APIs into your own prototype applications to perform proofs of concept on your use cases.

There is two paths you can take according to your profile and the maturity of your project, not exclusive if you want to go through both, which are either testing in the Telefónica's Open Gateway Sandbox environment or shifting to the Open Gateway platform of one of our Channel Partners, closer to a commercial stage.

## Telefónica Open Gateway Developer Hub

The Open Gateway Developer Hub is your ultimate resource for prototyping and testing your use cases with ease by using our [Sandbox](/docs/sandbox), and access to exclusive content like videos or webinars. Join a thriving community of developers, get support, and explore new features with the Open Gateway Developer Hub, the essential platform for all your development needs.

By joining our Developer Hub you will get early access to the Open Gateway APIs, whether there are already available through any of our Channel Partners or not, as well as the latest news and updates on the Open Gateway initiative.

One of the main benefits of joining our Developer Hub is having access to the Telefónica Open Gateway Sandbox to actually test the APIs, but there are many other advantages from being part of our community...

### Telefónica Open Gateway Sandbox

The Open Gateway Sandbox from Telefónica is a free environment where you can test the Open Gateway APIs. It is a great way to start testing the APIs and services in a controlled environment, without the need to sign a contract or pay for the service.

Our Sandbox will offer you a set of APIs to test, through the same interfaces and same developer experience that our Channel Partners will provide you with. Take into account that this will help getting started faster and easier, but it is not intended for production use but for testing, learning and prototyping instead.

When you are ready to move to production, you will need to contact one of our Channel Partners and shift your concepts into actual applications which could need porting part of your code, specially if using our Sandbox's SDK, to the Channel Partner's toolkits and be completed with the proper environmental and operational stuff.
