# Getting started

Once you are familiar with the Open Gateway initiative and the APIs we offer, you will want to start testing them into your own prototype applications to perform proofs of concept on your use cases.

There is two paths you can take according to the maturity of your project, not exclusive if you want to go through both, which are either testing in the Telef贸nica's Open Gateway Sandbox environment or shifting to the Open Gateway platform of one of our Channel Partners, closer to a commercial stage.

## Telef贸nica's Open Gateway Sandbox

The Open Gateway Sandbox from Telef贸nica is a free environment where you can test the Open Gateway APIs. It is a great way to start testing the APIs and services in a controlled environment, without the need to sign a contract or pay for the service.

Our Sandbox will offer you a set of APIs to test, through the same interfaces and same developer experience that our Channel Partners will provide you with. Take into account that this will help getting started faster and easier, but it is not intended for production use but for testing, learning and prototyping instead.

When you are ready to move to production, you will need to contact one of our Channel Partners and shift your concepts into actual applications which could need porting part of your code, specially if using our Sandbox's SDK, to the Channel Partner's toolkits and be completed with the proper environmental and operational stuff.
